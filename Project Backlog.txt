Brainstorming for the second half: https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder608/60099608.jpg
**Simply brainstorming** (it doens't matter how outlandish it seems we just need something to think about)

-Add java doc style comments above methods 
-Create animated seaweed in the background
-Have the background be ominiously dark and as such seem like you are underwater
-Possibly have enemies shoot towards the player
-All custom sprites?
-Additional enemies/ random pathing?
-Make fish come from all directions
-moving platforms
-oxygen tanks animate while sitting (float up and down)
-more oxygen tank locations
-moving oxygen tanks


Project Backlog:

NEED (for game to be played):
- DETERMINE THIS LATER

POSSIBLE:
- Add animations for character
	- Running
	- Swimming up
	- Holding down while standing
	- Holding down while swimming
- Add enemies
	- Crab
		- Move along floor/platforms
- Moving platforms
	- the character would have to move with the platform if standing on it
	- the oxygen tanks would have to move with the platform if on top
- Move code in tick() into different methods to make tick() cleaner.
- Add more tank locations (why not)
- Custom graphics (16-bit/8-bit style)

COMPLETED FIFTH ITERATION
- (Aaron) Added custom graphics
	- Bitmap for platforms
		- randomly chooses color from set
	- Bitmap for floor
	- Bitmap for bullets (now trident)
- (Aaron) Added sound effects
	- powerups
		- bubble
		- repair
		- bomb
	- throwing trident
	- Fish deaths
		- randomly chooses from 3 different blood sounds
	- player running into fish (roblox doeath sound)

COMPLETED FOURTH ITERATION
- (Ben) Wrote dynamic collision function
- (Ben) Updated game over logic
- (Ben) Added powerups
	- 3 different powerups
		- Oxygen powerup
			- Adds some oxygen to give player more time to get to next oxygen tank
		- Bomb powerup
			- removes all enemies on screen
		- repair powerup
			- removes some water from drowning bar.
	- Randomly chooses between 3 powerups
	- Random x location, falls from top of screen and dissappears at bottom
	- Collisions for player and powerups
- (Ben) Design document
	- P2 step 1
	- P2 step 2
	- P2 step 3
- (Aaron) Added sprites for powerups
	- Oxygen powerup -> "bubble.png"
	- bomb powerup -> "bomb.png"
	- repair powerup -> "repair.png"
- (Aaron) Beginning to re-design code
	- Increased readability. Function names describe what the function does. Whoever is reading the code can go look into the function to see how it is done, but does not need to because they know what it does.
	- Split init() into specific functions
		- game_build()
		- set_controls()
		- game_start()
	- split tick (game_step) into specific functions
		- check_controls()
		- apply_gravity()
		- add_enemies()
		- change_oxygen_and_stamina()
		- check_collisions()
		- powerUpLogic()
- (Aaron) Added background music

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Project 1 below

COMPLETED THIRD ITERATION
- (Aaron) Add "Drowning" aspect to oxygen bar
	- When it runs out, a second bar (red or dark blue) begins to fill up
	- Game slows down (slow down ticker)
	- Transparent red (or blue) layer appears
	- When you get a tank, it fill up oxygen bar half of the way
		- drowning bar begins to drop slowly
		- once oxygen runs out again, drowning bar begins to go up again
- (Aaron) Add Shooting
	- press SPACEBAR to shoot
	- bullets shoot in the direction the character was facing when fired
	- remove bullets when they go offscreen
	- only allow 5 bullets on screen at once
- (Ben) Increased canvas size to 1280x720
- (Aaron) Added stamina bar for shooting
	- doesn't allow to shoot when stamina bar is empty
	- requires recovery period after shooting or running out of stamina.

COMPLETED SECOND ITERATION
- (Aaron) Add Score
	- goes up over time
- (Aaron) Change oxygen bar to be on the canvas rather than using HTML
- (Ben) Add collisions with Oxygen tank
	- Add to score
	- Move oxygen tank to different location
- (Ben) Move Oxygen tank to different location
- (Aaron) Make oxygen drop faster each tank collected
- (Aaron) Make score go up more with each tank
- (Aaron) Add game over sequence
	- Allow ability to reset game


COMPLETED FIRST ITERATION
- Create canvas
- Create ocean floor
- Add background
- Add gravity
	- don't allow character to fall through ocean floor
- Make smooth keyboard controls
	- arrow keys to swim around
	- hold down to sink faster
- Don't allow character to swim above screen
- Make going left or right (out of bounds) teleport to opposite side
	- alike to pacman
- Create character sprite
- Create oxygen tank sprite
- Create remaining oxygen bar
- Make character sprite turn left and right with correct direction
- Create platforms as Rectangle Shape objects
	- If character is standing on platform, gravity does not affect
	- If player holds down, they can fall through platforms
	- player can swim up through the bottom of platforms
- Change collision with platforms into a re-usable method
- Add more platforms
